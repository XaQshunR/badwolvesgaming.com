Bad Wolves maintains a community-ran game server hosting platform built on [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io). This 
enables us to easily create game worlds for our members. Some members also run their own game servers outside of
our officially supported system for the pack to enjoy. We believe that by making it easy for members to host private
game servers our community is able to experience online multiplayer games in more unique and engaging ways.

## Requests

We accept requests for game servers that the pack wants to play. If you are an active member and would like to
play a game or a modpack that we do not currently have hosted please reach out in the requests channel of our Discord.
This service is made possible by our community members and is free to all members. Please keep in mind that server space
is limited and requests will be fufilled based upon community interest.

## Contribute

We greatly appreciate those looking to contribute to our hosting platform. There are several ways to contribute to our
community.

### Host a node

Have a server or old computer laying around? Adding a node to our hosting platform enables us to support more games at
once. The more servers we have, the more we can do! If you're intersted in contributing a node to our official hosting
platform, get in touch with an admin on Discord to get started.

### Host your own game server

If you'd prefer to run your own server outside of our official community system, we welcome that as well! If you'd like
your game server to be featured here, get in touch with an admin in our Discord.

### Other ways to contribute

Don't have a server but still want to contribute? Consider Boosting us on Discord!

Bring your friends! Bringing new people helps grow and strengthen the pack.

Bad Wolves does not want your money and while we are humbled by anyone willing to contribute financially, we do not
currently accept monitary donations. The small amount of money needed to keep this system running does not currently 
justify even a donation button.
