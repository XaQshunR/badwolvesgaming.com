title: About The Pack
---

The Bad Wolves Community is an 18+ gaming community designed by gamers, for gamers both casual and hardcore. We melt our
playstyles together to compliment each other with a focus on co-operative team and group play, with of course
competitive tendencies. We do not require members to play any particular way in order to be a member. We have members
that at times do not participate in any of the games we play and are around just for the camaraderie. We like to operate
by the idea of if we are not having fun, we are not doing it right. And this goes without speaking for every aspect of
the Bad Wolf community.

Our team is lead by seasoned leadership from many corners of the gaming world under the shared vision of not only just
playing together, but staying united no matter the paths and games we end up playing. We have seen too often what the
instability of fickle and unsteady leadership does to groups of gamers and friends and hope to unite all those who find
appeal in our vision so that we may have a community in any game our members decide to delve into. So it has become our
mission to not only unite friends, but to unite them with new friends and new challenges.

## Our Community Mantra (aka the rules)

Not following these simple guidelines will get you removed from Bad Wolves. 

### Don't be a dick or a douche

This means, being constantly abrasive, rude or doing things that are not nice to other pack members. 

### Don't harass or grief a fellow Bad Wolf

This is self explanatory, if you don't understand you should just leave. 

### Bad Wolves is a community of adult gamers who work as a team, we are not for lone wolves or glory hounds

We are a selfless community that works to protect and grow through teamwork. selfish mentalities are not welcome here. The community is normally good at providing an environment that discourages the selfish and egotistical but sometimes they can be thick skulled and will need to be culled from time to time. If you loot whore, roll on side grades when items are a significant upgrade for others, gloat and laud over your fellow members or practice exclusionary behaviors, you are a clear example of what we are not looking for.
 
### Do not shout, scream or use voice modifying software over VOIP

We are adults and all communication should be carried on as maturely as possible, nobody wants their eardrums assaulted by some neckbeard. 

### Bring something to the community

Members should be bringing something to the community, whether its Steam/Facebook activity, Discord conversation
