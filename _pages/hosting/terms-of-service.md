Availability of server space is subject to the capacity of our nodes, community demand, and resource allocation. We understand that our users may have specific preferences and requirements for their game servers, and while we strive to fulfill these requests, there may be instances where we cannot immediately provide server space due to resource limitations.

We appreciate your understanding of these constraints. In the event that server space is not immediately available, we may work with you to find suitable alternatives or explore options to meet your hosting needs.

By using our services, you acknowledge and accept that server space availability is contingent on the number of nodes we have and the demand within the community.
