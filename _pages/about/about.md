Bad Wolves Gaming is an international, non-politically correct gaming community. 
We do not require members to play any particular way in order to be a member. 
We have members that at times do not participate in any of the games we play 
and are around just for the camaraderie. We like to operate by the idea of if 
we are not having fun, we are not doing it right.

Our team is supported by leadership from many corners of the gaming "multiverse"
under the shared vision of not only just playing a single game together, but
staying together no matter the paths and games we end up playing. Many of us
have too often experienced the fractured groups of gamers and friends. We hope
to unite all those who find appeal in our vision so that we may have a community
in any game our members decide to delve into. So it has become our mission to
not only unite friends, but to unite them with new friends and new challenges.
