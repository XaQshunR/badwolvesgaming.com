Wolves, welcome to this special holiday update, I hope you're all having a good time out there. I've got a few updates for you and also some info on a community giveaway we're doing for Christmas.

## Discord Updates

As I'm sure you've probably noticed, we've been making a few improvements to our Discord. Really trying to make things easier to find and utilize the tools Discord gives us. Here's a quick summary of a few of the key changes:

### Wolfguard got an Upgrade

![wolfguard.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/posts/wolfguard.png){: .align-left}

Wolfguard, our pack guardian, got an AI update. He has a backstory and will respond "in character" if you talk to him. He also now can create AI generated stories and images for you. This is available for all Wolves with some monthly usage limits per user. You can access these using `/write` and `/imagine` in a chat. This could be really useful for helping to create some cool D&D backstories or character images. Try it out!

### Reaction Roles

Reaction roles are gone, replaced by the built-in Discord roles. If you haven't checked out the Channels & Roles tab at the top of our Discord yet, please head there and assign whatever channels/roles you'd like to have. As a side-note to this, if you like the classic Discord view of always showing you everything, you can also hit the server name and check the box for `Show All Channels`.

### Temporary Group Channels

I've seen quite a few people using these, which is awesome. If you haven't checked them out, this creates a temporary voice channel that you can use for whatever game you're playing to separate yourself from other games or even multiple groups within the same game.

### Server Guide & Info

We've updated our Server Guide tab with some info about the pack and links. You can also find info about our hosting platform and some of the current game server info is in here too.

## Website Updates

Our website has seen several minor changes recently that bring more of our pack info into the site and off of Discord. The aim is to ensure some of this basic pack info and structure is preserved even outside of Discord. Ultimately our community exists beyond Discord and many of you have seen our transitions between multiple platforms over the years.

We've also put a little time into coming up with some cool logos, banners, etc. that bring some consistency and uniqueness to the Bad Wolves. You should see consistent iconography and colors throughout our website, Discord, and other places, such as Facebook & Spectrum.

## Star Citizen & Giveaway

We've been trying to drum-up interest in Star Citizen again. With CIG making some moves, some improvements to the game, and SQ42 seemingly on the horizon, naturally there is more interest in playing. This year to celebrate Christmas and the recent resurgence in interest we're going to be doing a Star Citizen Giveaway. Actually, we're doing 2.

### Giveaway

We're giving away 1 Star Citizen game package with a copy of the game and the new Syulen ship, including LTI to an existing Bad Wolves member who does not have Star Citizen yet. We're also giving away 1 Syulen ship with LTI (not a full game package) to an existing member of our Bad Wovles Syndicate fleet. Info on how to enter and eligibility are below

#### How to enter

When the giveaways go live, you'll be able to enter by clicking the participate button on the giveaway post in the announcements channel.

#### How to win

A winner is randomly selected out of the pool of participants. We'll reach out to you via DM to send your prize.

#### Eligibility

##### Game Package Giveaway

- Be an existing, active member of Bad Wolves
- Be new to Star Citizen without a game package

##### Stand-alone Ship Giveaway

- Be an existing, active member of Bad Wolves
- Already have Star Citizen
- Have [_Fleet Clearance_](#-fleet-clearance) access role in Discord (more info below)

### Fleet Clearance

Fleet clearance is a role in Discord granted to verified members of the Bad Wolves Syndicate fleet. Existing members of Bad Wolves still need to follow the steps below to gain the role. This role does a couple of things:

1. It allows us to control access to any info about our fleet that we want to keep private from other orgs, visitors, etc.
2. It helps us understand how many active players we have in Star Citizen.

#### How to get Fleet Clearance

1. Be an active member of Bad Wolves
2. Apply for membership on our [RSI page](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/BADWOLVES)

Optionally, you may also join our [Fleetyards](https://fltyrd.net/fi/mHVrl4vKEA/). This will help us understand the size of our total fleet better.

If you've done both steps and you still don't have access, please ask in Discord for help. This role is being manually assigned, so its possible we missed you or you were added after the latest time we checked.

## Happy Hunting
And thats it for now, I hope you liked the update.
