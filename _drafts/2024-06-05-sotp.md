**Wolves**,

I’m excited and honored to bring you my first ever State of the Pack update! At this point I’ve probably met most of you, but if not, hi, I’m dy1io. I’ve been a part of the Bad Wolves community for a long time at this point. I generally have kept to myself, but as Fate mentioned in the [last SotP post](/announcement/2023/10/27/sotp.html), over the past few years I’ve taken a more active role in the overall pack leadership. I’m excited to help continue to grow this community.

With that out of the way, we’ve got some pretty great updates lined up for you all this time around:

## Games We’re Playing

### Soulmask

This is an Ark-style survival game with a few twists. Theres been a small group of us playing over the past few days and we’re having a good time building a base and exploring the world. We’ve got a dedicated server up if you’d like to join, or if you just want to watch there’s usually a couple of us streaming in the Wolf Den.

### Pax Dei

Pax Dei is an upcoming Sandbox MMO. The first two beta tests went well and the game will be in Early Access starting June 18th. We’ve got a number of community members planning on playing. After extensive time in the alpha we've located some options that we think are an optimal base location for resources and the team has a fast-track strategy for hitting higher tiers day one of early access. Redforest is taking the initiative to head this one up, hit him up if you want to get in on the action. You can check out Pax Dei here: [https://playpaxdei.com/en-us]()

### Minecraft

Always a staple, our persistent TNP 7 server is still online and getting regular updates thanks to Kain’s hard work. Kain is also exploring some additional options for future persisent Minecraft servers, stay tuned for that. We’ve also got a group playing on Craft to Exile 2, a “Mine to Slash” ARPG mod. Checkout their respective channels in Discord for the details.

### ESO

ESO’s latest expansion just dropped and I’ll be checking this out over the next few months. Happy to have anyone join. Hoping to get a couple more people to explore the new zone with me.

### Star Citizen

Star Citizen has been **hoppin'** lately. 3.23 just dropped and the quality-of-life changes alone have been game-changing. 3.23.2, which is hopefully coming soon brings the long-awaited personal hangers and cargo refactor. 4.0, with Pyro, is right around the corner. I hope to see the momentum here continue to grow.

## Hosting platform:

![Hosting](/assets/images/hosting/logo.png){:width="128px"}

And last but not least, as you probably know, Bad Wolves has had a bit of a game hosting platform running various Minecraft servers or what have you for a couple of years now. We used off-the-shelf software for this and, while it worked, I’ve always wanted a bit more. 

We’ve now launched “Bad Wolves Hosting”. This is our own custom, dedicated hosting platform. The goal is simple: we want professional-grade server hosting in terms of features and reliability, but at a better price: free.

Any member of the Bad Wolves community can have access to this and we’re working on continuing to add features to make gaming together easier and more accessible. This project is a work in progress and we've got a roadmap of additional features planned for it. If you’re interested in taking advantage of this, hit me up and I can create you an account. We’re opening up self-registration soon.

You can learn more about it here: [https://badwolvesgaming.com/hosting/]()

This platform is entirely community driven. From the time that goes into it, to the servers. If you’re looking to contribute there are 3 ways to help out:

1. Use the platform and give feedback. This is the only way we can make it better.
2. You can host a “node” for us. Nodes are the underlying hardware that games actually run on. If you have an old computer laying around, it could probably be used as a node.
3. I am looking for 1 or 2 people to help with development. If you’re interested in helping out or if you just wanna geek out on the tech, hit me up.


Thats all for now. I’ll see you all in game.
