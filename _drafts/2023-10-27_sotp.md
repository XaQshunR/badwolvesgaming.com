# State of The Pack: Back to the Wolf Edition

I hope this finds you well my fellow wolves and friends of wolves. I know it’s been long overdue for a community update and I am looking forward to bringing you more news of our planned future activity on a more regular basis going forward. We have undergone a number of changes since last year and we have more planned to come that will hopefully excite and encourage many of you in getting involved in what we are putting together for all of you. Many of these changes are about us looking to get more activity going and growing our tight knit community so that we all have more options and people to enjoy all the games we love to play. Look forward to more announcements and be on the lookout for a bit of a visual refresh as we prepare for an exciting future within our pack!

## Leadership Updates:

I always like to be transparent with what is going on behind the scenes here and as I had inferred to last year, Dy1io has taken up the reins of pulling Bad Wolves back into the pioneering and prestigious community that many of you have known it to be in the past. Dy1io is spearheading the community leadership in his role as a Community Guardian which will now be a less forefront position as it has been known as we are combining our leadership team into a single Council that will now be meeting periodically in order to actively promote community events and optimize our operations.

With these changes I would like to welcome our Pablito to our Wolf Council. Pablito may not be known to many in our community as he is a leader of a more sophomore community that plays both Rust and Ark primarily called Lotus. He joined Bad Wolves during the Launch of Atlas and his Lotus community helped bolster our numbers in the chaotic waters that was the Atlas Launch days. We have stayed in close contact over the years and he actually led our small returns to Atlas over the years as a Bad Wolves Game Pack Leader. He and a handful of his members have commingled over the years with us and we have come to see our Communities as a family unit. Welcome to the Council Pablito, we appreciate your contributions and look forward to what you and our Lotus brothers & sisters bring to the Bad Wolves Greater Community.

With these changes we have pruned some roles. These were not done due to performance but more optimization and to create a clearer chain of leadership. We have eliminated the Community Officer role and combined it’s remaining members in the Moderator role which will henceforth be called the Watch Dog role to better theme with our community.

Any interests you may have should be vocalized to members of the Wolf Council when it comes to games of interest, activity or leadership roles. We are always looking for insight on the games and activities that you would like to play together with us.

Keep an eye out for more changes!

## What Are Our Wolves Doing:


### Star Citizen

Dy1io and JackHigh are looking to push more interest in this very anticipated title in the community. With the latest announcements and acceleration in development and release schedule things are ramping up and much of the hype around the needed server technology is becoming very prominent in the recent updates. We currently have a very small and tight knit organization in Star Citizen and a growing Alliance of allied communities that we will be utilizing to build a strong and independent coalition once the game goes to release. This current Alliance consists of up to 5 different organizations with close to 300 total members. My greater plan is for our organization to operate as a linch pin to these external groups who will act in concert to achieve both of our communities goals in game with Bad Wolves primarily providing logistical and tactical dominance experience as displayed in our alliance debut back during the 2021 New Years Eve Jump Town Event. This will absolutely evolve overtime, but is the current basis of our initial in-game activity premise where we will focus on being able to counter and harass organizations100 fold our size. We look forward to you joining our Fleet, let us know your interest in the Star Citizen chat channels.



### Ark Survival Evolved Servers

For the past several months Tink has been providing her Omega overhaul server which we are always grateful for her contribution and allowing our members to play in her Ark playground. Recently Tink has had to bring her server offline but to our luck Ser Mott has blessed our community with 3 dedicated and clustered servers. These servers will be primarily managed by Mott, Fate and Tink. We are currently working on a final overhaul mod list and will make an update to the Ark channels once that is finalized. If you have any interest in any mods or play modes please let us know in the Ark chats.



### Minecraft Servers

The current servers are Vault Hunters 2 and Direwolf20 both minecraft v1.19. These servers are currently managed and maintained by RedForest. Dy1io is also planing on hosting a pure Vanilla server so look out for that. If you have any mod pack recommendations please let Dy1io or RedForest know so they can help facilitate access.

### Elder Scrolls Online

Dy1io is still dedicated to maintaining our presence in the ESO universe and we are honored by his efforts. If you have any interest in joining us in game please let him know, we do have other members who may also be able to help assist and facilitate you joining our guild in game. Please feel free to let your interest be known in the ESO chat channels.


### Warhammer 40k: Inquisitor

Although this game appears to be winding down for some of us, this was a fun lil escape worth mentioning. We have created a “Cabal” in the game for you to join and Inquisitor plays like a mission drop Path of Exile-esk type of game set in the dark future where there is only Heresy. Please feel free to let us know if this game is of interest as several of us may still be interested in diving in for some more relic hunting.

### Stellaris

We most recently played with the 3.8 release and even did some empire co-op. This was a fun experience and I am sure that we will return back to this game soon and will most likely smartly play smaller maps with more competitive rules and difficulty to challenge our next playthroughs. Always let us know if you are interested. Modpacks are generally administered by Fatetaker, but he is always looking for others interested in managing and developing a current modpack.



### Tabletop RPG Mayhem!

Several members of our community are hosting game sessions during the week.
Sunday's Lickiwhirl is running a Pathfinder 2 campaign where the adventurers are trying to discover why different goblins are working together.
Saturday’s Fate and Goomba are taking group of vampires on a Dark Journey through the World of Darkness in a new campaign starting late Saturday night
Wednesday’s Fatetaker may be starting a new Cyberpunk campaign and is currently looking for more interested players in very late night campaign (11am CST+)
