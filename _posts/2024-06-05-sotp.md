**Wolves**, I’m honored to bring you my first ever State of the Pack update! At this point I’ve probably met most of you, but if not: hi, I’m dy1io, in game I typically go by Lumiaris. I’ve been a part of the Bad Wolves community for a long time at this point, but I generally have kept to myself. As Fate mentioned in the [last SotP post](/announcement/2023/10/27/sotp.html), over the past few years I’ve taken a more active role in the overall pack leadership. These "State of the Pack" posts have been long-standing hallmark here: they highlight what we've been up to and where we're going. Its a great way to sum up a season and I’m excited to be able to continue that tradition.

With that out of the way, let’s get into it:

## What we're up to right now

### Soulmask

This is an Ark-style survival game with a few twists. Theres been a small group of us playing over the past few days and we’re having a good time building a base and exploring the world. We’ve got a dedicated server up if you’d like to join, or if you just want to watch there’s usually a couple of us streaming in the Wolf Den.


### Pax Dei

The Pack is abuzz lately with Pax Dei, an upcoming Sandbox MMO. We participated in both alpha phases and the game will be launching in Early Access on June 18th. We’ve got a number of community members planning on joining in. After extensive time in the alpha we've located some options that we think are an optimal base location for resources and the team has a fast-track strategy for hitting higher tiers day one of early access. Redforest is taking the initiative to head this one up, hit him up if you want to get in on the action. You can check out Pax Dei here: [https://playpaxdei.com/en-us](https://playpaxdei.com/en-us)


### Minecraft

Always a staple, our persistent TNP 7 server is still online and getting regular updates thanks to Kain’s hard work. We're exploring some additional options for future persistent Minecraft servers, stay tuned for that. We’ve also got a group playing on Craft to Exile 2, a “Mine to Slash” ARPG mod. Checkout their respective channels in Discord for the details.


### ESO

ESO’s latest expansion, Gold Road, just dropped and I’ll be checking this out over the next few months. This one is a personal favorite of mine and I hope to get a couple more people to explore the new zone with.


### Star Citizen

Star Citizen has been **hoppin'** lately. 3.23 just dropped and the quality-of-life changes alone have been game-changing. 3.23.2, which is hopefully coming soon brings the long-awaited personal hangers and cargo refactor. 4.0, with Pyro, is right around the corner. I hope to see the momentum here continue to grow. We've got a dedicated page for Star Citizen where you can find all the details: [https://badwolvesgaming.com/star-citizen](/star-citizen/)


### Bad Wolves Hosting

![Hosting](/assets/images/hosting/logo.png){:width="128px"}

And last but not least, as you probably know, Bad Wolves has had a bit of a game hosting platform running various Minecraft servers or what have you for a couple of years now. We used off-the-shelf software for this and, while it worked, I’ve always wanted a bit more. 

We’ve now launched “Bad Wolves Hosting”. This is our own custom, dedicated hosting platform. The goal is simple: we want professional-grade server hosting in terms of features and reliability, but at a better price: free.

Any member of the Bad Wolves community can have access to this and we’re working on continuing to add features to make gaming together easier and more accessible. This project is a labor of love and a work in progress. This is just the beginning, we've got a roadmap of additional features planned for the future. If you’re interested in taking advantage of this, hit me up in Discord and I can create you an account. We’re opening up self-registration soon(tm).

This platform is entirely community driven. From the time that goes into it, to the hardware. If you’re looking to contribute there are 3 ways to help out:

1. Use the platform and give feedback. This is the only way we can make it better.
2. You can host a “node” for us. Nodes are the underlying hardware that games actually run on. If you have an old computer laying around, it could probably be used as a node.
3. I am looking for 1 or 2 people to help with development. 

This will always be free, but if you’re interested in helping out or if you just wanna geek out on the tech, shoot me a DM.

You can learn more here: [https://badwolvesgaming.com/hosting](/hosting/)

Thats all for now. I’ll see you all in game.
