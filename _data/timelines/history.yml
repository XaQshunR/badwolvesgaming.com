    Bad Wolves Gaming was founded in September of 2012 by a group of guild-mates
    who were tired of the drama and politics that plagued other guilds. We wanted
    to create a community that was focused on having a good time first and that
    could stick together no matter what game we play.

    After a period of inactivity, we experienced a resurgence in 2022. 
    During this time we really honed-in on our core games including Star Citizen, 
    Minecraft, ESO, and more. We also launched our new community website, new Discord 
    server, and started working on our own game server hosting platform.
