      Bad Wolves Gaming was founded from the ashes of Doomriders Mercenary 
      Corps of Mech Warrior Online. We were tired of the drama and politics 
      that plagued other guilds and wanted to create a community that would 
      stick together and focus on having a good time.

      After our first official division, Day-Z, was launched 
      in 2012, we quickly followed that up with divisions in Minecraft, FFXIV, 
      Warframe, and Eve. Some of which continues to live on today. FFXIV would grow
      to be the community's largest divison to date boasting 500+ active members.

      This period would mark the peak of our activity in Eve, Warframe, and other 
      legacy divisions. Divisions were added in Ark, Atlas and a few more. Ark 
      would grow to become one of our most successful divisions with many members 
      continuing that success into the Atlas division.

      2019 marked the end of our official Atlas division, and with it a decline
      in focused activity. With several members forced to stay home in 2020, we 
      continued to maintain activity through our Minecraft server, and a few 
      members remaining in legacy divisions.

      After a period of inactivity, we experienced a resurgence in 2021 starting 
      with the offical launch of our Star Citizen division. We created a new 
      website, Discord, and started working on our own game hosting platform. 
      During this time, Bad Wolves maintained several Minecraft servers, returned 
      to ESO, briefly explored New World, and more.

      After several iterations, we finally officially launched our community 
      hosting platform, Bad Wolves Hosting, with the goal of enabling our 
      community to host their own game servers at no cost.
